# Multi-UAV Cooperative Surveillance

This project presents a simulation platform for cooperative aerial surveillance using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Provided graphical user interface (GUI) of the simulator contains the automatically created birdâ€™s eye view of a 3D virtual environment. This is used to enter locations and parameters of objects (UAVs, charging stations, and areas to be surveyed) and also to visualize the progress of the surveillance. The platform also contains a system for the analysis of the quality of surveillance, whose results are presented in the GUI in the form of a time graph and a heat map. Part of the proposed platform is a UAV objective-based control system and charging stations scheduling to enable persistent missions. A total of seven algorithms for cooperative surveillance had been proposed, implemented, tested, and analyzed for coverage quality on various scenarios. This platform has been developed utilizing [Pogamut](http://pogamut.cuni.cz/) and [USARSim](https://sourceforge.net/projects/usarsim/).
